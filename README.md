Look at the shape, pick the correct top-down projection.

## Compiling

Compiling requires ImageMagick. Download a home-grown build from your favourite package manager, or [download](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

`cargo build`, or `cargo build --release` if you want a small executable (link time optimisation is enabled for release builds).
`cargo run` also works to skip a step.
